Here's my vision:
For my job, I must log time for various client and internal purposes every day.
I envisioned having a set of "chess clocks", one for each category of task.
At its simplest, I would like to keep it open during the day, and as I switch tasks, either create a new timer,
or (if I've already created one) click on the corresponding existing timer for that task.
If used diligently, at the end of the day I would have an clear readout of the time spend on each project,
and that could be easily transered to our time tracking software.
